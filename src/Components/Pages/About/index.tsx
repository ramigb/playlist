        This is a very simple website, after you create a playlist you can share
        the URL to it with your friends and they can access your playlist
      </p>
      <p>Why would you use this you may ask? good question amigo ...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Nothing is saved anywhere, no database or logging on the server side,
          nada.*
        </li>
        <li>No account is needed! fuck registering right?</li>
        <li>Free and no ads!</li>
        <li>Why not?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I made this website because I needed it ... I need to share playlists
        with my friends, I hope you enjoy it
      </p>
